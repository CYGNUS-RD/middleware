# Middle Ware
the Middle Ware project aim to realize a Computing Model (CM) for [CYGNO](https://web.infn.it/cygnus/) and small/medium experiments in the astroparticle physics community: [CYGNO](https://web.infn.it/cygnus/), like many other astroparticle experiments, requires a computing model to acquire, store, simulate and analyze data typically far from High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. Indeed, astroparticle experiments are typically characterized by the fact to be less demanding from computing resources with respect to HEP one but have to deal with unique and unrepeatable data, sometimes collected in extreme conditions, with extensive use of templates and Montecarlo, and are often re-calibrated and reconstructed many times for a given data sets. Moreover, the varieties and the scale of computing models and requirements are extremely large. In this scenario, the Cloud infrastructure with standardized and optimized services offered to the scientific community could be a useful solution able to match the requirements of many small/medium size experiments. This repository contain, beyond then Data Acquisition System [DAQ](https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/daq) that is specialyzed for the exepreiment, contains the [CYGNO](https://web.infn.it/cygnus/) computing model based on the [INFN cloud infrastructure](https://www.cloud.infn.it/) where the experiment software, easily extensible to similar experiments to similar applications on other similar experiments, providings tools as a service to store, for the data managment, for anlysis, and simulation.
